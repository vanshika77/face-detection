FACE DETECTION
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This project is about training a model on a set of human photographs and predicting an image on trained model.
Here i have trained my model on 5 classes i.e. images of 5 people.
I had less number of photographs to train my model, hence i have used ImageDataGenerator to increase number of photographs for each class.

Lets see how ImageDataGenerator works.
The Keras deep learning neural network library provides the capability to fit models using image data augmentation via the ImageDataGenerator class.
